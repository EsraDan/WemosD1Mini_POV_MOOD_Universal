# WemosD1Mini_POV_MOOD_Universal
beginner pcb, soldering practice, THD or THD+SMD, multifunction-project

The makerspace attraktor in Hamburg offers monthly soldering classes.
Typical beginner PCBs are often low quality and even more often quite boring.

This projects contains all data to order the PCB as well as the bill of material to assembly the board.
The heart of the project is a WEMOS mini D1, that basing on a ESP8266. 
So in contrast to a normal Arduino, you can control the PCBA via wifi. Means it is a first hardware step in the world of Internet of Things.

There are two assembly variants right now. The “persistence of view” and the “mood light”.
But the PCB offers further possible to connect WS8266-LED-strips and using the analog input.
All pins are easy accessible for own projects. So the PCB is never waste.
